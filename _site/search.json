My main interests are urban economics, real estate economics, and environmental economics. This year, I am writing my master’s thesis on earthquake-risk mapping and its impact on land and real estate prices in Japan. I am also learning Japanese, as I will be participating in an exchange program in Kobe starting in April.\n\n\n\n",
