## About Me

I graduated from **ENS Lyon** with a degree in **Advanced Economics**. My main interests are **urban economics**, **real estate economics**, and **environmental economics**. This year, I am writing my master's thesis on earthquake-risk mapping and its impact on land and real estate prices in Japan. I am also learning Japanese, as I will be participating in an exchange program in Kobe starting in April.
