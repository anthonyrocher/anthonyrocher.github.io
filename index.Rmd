## About Me

I am in my final year of my master's degree in **Advanced Economics** at the **ENS of Lyon**. My main interests are **urban economics**, **real estate economics**, and **environmental economics**. I am writing my master's thesis on earthquake-risk mapping and its impact on land and real estate prices in Japan. I will visit the Department of Economics of Kobe University starting in March.
